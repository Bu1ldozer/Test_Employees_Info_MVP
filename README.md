# Test_Employees_Info_MVP
Implementation MVP with no database. Works with internet only

This is one version of the Test tasks I did. The aim was to implement an employees list, which contains cards 
with a names, surnames, and specializations. We got the data from JSON on the transmitted link. 
The MVP pattern was used.
